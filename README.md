- Kuro Bot is a Discord bot that simulates what a conversation with a good friend of mine is like to a scary degree of accuracy

- Responds to any message containing "kuro" or "kuwo" with a random statement
- !quote
    - returns a random quote that was said by Kuro
- !poll
    - creates a poll with the given question
- !stats

## TODO:
